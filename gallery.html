    <h3>HTML5:Figure and Figure Caption</h3>
    <h3>&lt;figure/&gt; /&lt;figure&gt</h3>
    <h6>
      Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new element to
      contain images and their captions so that the two are associated. You can
      have more than one image inside the element as long as they all share the
      same caption.
    </h6>
    <h3>&lt;figcaption/&gt; /&lt;figcaption&gt;</h3>
    <h6>
      The element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page author to
      add a caption to an image. Before these elements were created there was no
      way to associate an element with its caption. Older web browsers that do
      not understand HTML5 elements simply ignore the new elements and display
      the content of them.
    </h6>
    <img src="img/my.jpg" width="200px" hight="200px" />
    <h6>This image is wonderful. The caption is in figcaption tags</h6>
    <img src="img/download.jpg" width="200px" hight="200px" />
    <h6>This is the second image. The caption is in figcaption tags.</h6>
